# Discord Minecraft Controller

Discord Minecraft Controller (or Minecraft Discord Edition) is a Discord Bot that makes Minecraft playable through a Discord Guild or Discord Channel.  

## Installation

You need to follow some simple steps:
1. First of all, download it from the releases section ([Click here](https://github.com/DolphinGamerYT/discord-minecraft-controller/releases) or in the right) to download it.
2. Once downloaded, execute it. Because its the first time, program will exit, but it will create a config.yml file.
  2.1. You need to create a Discord Bot, and generate a token [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications). 
    2.1.1. Copy the token, and paste on the token setting.
    2.1.2. Invite the Bot to your server.
  2.2. (Optional) You can modify the delay between actions that are spaced in the same message.
3. Execute it again, and if you followed the steps correctly, you should be able to see your bot online!

## Usage

Open Minecraft, and start a world. Then, stream your Minecraft Screen on a voice channel, and open the bot. Focus the Minecraft window, and with your mobile phone, or another pc, go to a text channel and type `!start`.

## Troubleshotting

> Mouse is not moving!

+1.15: Go to Esc > Controls > Mouse Settings > Disable "Raw Input"

If not, it is impossible to solve.


## Limitations

Because of Mouse Input, you will need to focus the window, since there is no compatible way to move mouse on a app (more unlikely on a game) and running discord.py.
